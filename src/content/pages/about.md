title: About Jared
---
Oklahoma transplant and graduate of the Virginia Tech School of Communication where I taught public speaking, hiked the mountains, and occasionally got to perform improv. My thesis research focused on the ontological blurring between humans and artificial intelligence as it related to gender and purchase intent. I come from nearly 10 years of professional marketing and communication experience from large companies such as Walt Disney World® Resort and Wal-Mart, to public sectors like Langston University.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an increasingly integrated aspect of daily life. Particularly, businesses have been incorporating AI into many features of their business from customer support to product personalization. My research focuses on whether relationships that form through purchase intention, trust or even sense of agency utilize the same theoretical frameworks with humans as AI or will new theories need to be developed. 

I am looking for opportunities to share my knowledge of communication in a higher education setting and continue following AI communication trends. Also, I would love to connect for further topical discussions, opportunities, or potential research collaborations!
