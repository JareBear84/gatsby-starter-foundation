  So, I celebrate my negative face.

I have come to a conclusion, in a purely hyperbolic sense, after struggling to digest and mold the readings this week into something tangible enough to discuss or analyze. This conclusion surprises no one in my close social circle, but does fuel the confusion they have after witnessing my career in marketing and communications that has lasted more than a decade - I really, really do not like people. I have a desire for autonomy, freedom from obstruction, and independence, which means I probably have permanent negative face (Pitts et al, 2013).

This conclusion from the readings is like the novelty bottles with the miniature ships inside them, or the narrative trope of finding a message in the bottle. I could see the letter or ship trapped inside the large base, but could not pull it out of the thin neck of the bottle. Reading about the message was like looking at these complex theories that are dependent on social understandings, and our very purpose for communicating them is existent on the mutual understanding of individuals from past and present as a society, community or culture. Our behavior is supposedly dictated by these established rules of engagement. By whom? Eh, everybody. It is like I am looking at the breakdown of the message from our readings thought a glass bottle. I see them. I acknowledge the logic behind them. But I just do not *get it*.

Am I supposed to be playing some sort of tactical game to upkeep a social persona/status when leaving voicemails for loved ones? (Knobloch et al, 2010) Is this why I have no friends? The rest of this response is not a critique of the theories in our textbook (Littlejohn, 2017) or findings of the research journals, but to understand how the little ship in the bottle, which will be my metaphor for the theories and ideas presented this week about message, is made and how the concepts are used in the real life version.

I started off enjoying the review of semiotics and how the basic units of verbal and nonverbal messages can be understood (Littlejohn, 2017). As a creative type, I appreciate the breakdown of signs and symbols and the complex tunnels we travel to find meaning in them. I recently watched the movie *Snowpiercer* about the last of humanity being stuck on a train in a forever looping track, which was a beautiful symbol of society maintaining stark social classes puts it on a never changing path.

I held on during the interpretation section. Thanks to our introduction to Epistemology, I could understand the theories of language forming because of the knowledge we gain from group-shared experience. I also found the idea that the dominate gender can incorporate their experiences into language, like English being a “man-made” language (Littlejohn, 2017), an eye opening experience.

I had difficulty reading the rest after coordinated management of meaning (CMM). Not because the information was challenging or my comprehension was lacking, but I physically had trouble reading because my eyes were rolling so much. While it was not outright stated, but the overview of theory of identification felt like a guide on how to be a sleezy used car salesman. I gathered from the book that if you want to persuade someone, that person must identify with you. That is, the one who becomes persuaded sees that one party is like another in some way (Littlejohn, 2017). This concept was glazed over in the Ducan (2019) study with college students being persuaded during online discussions. They had many similarities and more than likely practiced civil discourse. It didn’t cover the crazy arguments that can happen on a local news station’s Facebook post. If anything, younger generations know to stay away from online debates with strangers because it is pointless and just measuring “digital genitalia.”

Message design logic and politeness theory made me scratch my head the most. Yes, to communicate, a message is best understood universally. That is what we as professionals are paid to do. But when message design logic is covering how Conventional logic dictates communication as a means of self-expression according to accepted rules and norms, it makes me pause. From an artistic expression standpoint, telling a story or self expression is a way to break through societal norms to get a point across. And I still can’t comprehend the politeness theory face aspect. Do people really put that much credit in maintaining a positive face for some societal benefit?

I may be biased because I had a difficult relationship with my parents, but I will not need communication accommodation theory to help me decide which openers might elicit certain kinds of responses (Pitts et al, 2013). We often drove by a Baptist Retirement Community and tell our parents “Hey! It’s like looking into a crystal ball.” I do not have the healthiest relationship with my parents and they are free to live their final days how they like. It’s none of my concern. Maybe this negative face is what helped me with my marriage. I wasn’t worried about up-keeping a positive face, and I was happy being with my now wife as I would be without her?

At this point, I am ready to just accept my negative face. I can keep the ship or message in the bottle, and put on the shelf to gaze upon alone with my dog, Large Marge, who only wants three things: treats, toys and tummy tickles. Now, that is something I understand and want to be a part of.
