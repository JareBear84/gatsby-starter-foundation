The readings this week set up the images of a smoky, dark staging area of a back alley comedy club where up and coming comedian Jerry Seinfeld approaches the single mike standing in the middle of the spotlight and says, “Why are there so many communication theories? We all know what it means, but we have a million theories why we want to take down the patriarchy!”

Joking introduction on Craig (1993) aside, there was an interesting juxtaposition between the *Theories of Human Communication* (2016) general categorization and typing of communicationtheory and the direct philosophical foundations fueling the pointed arguments of Tennis (2008) and Craig (1993). At first we are asked to ponder if reality external to us or is it all in our head? Is reality objective or is it more personal? Is there free will or destiny? Should we look to ourselves or numbers and statistics to draw conclusions? (Littlejohn et al., 2016) Whereas Tennis (2008) and Craig (1993) say, “No. Theory is all nomothetic!”

**What Communication Theory is and Should be**

While dealing with knowledge organization (KO), readers are led to believe a positivist view of epistemic research due to the systematic view on reality, our knowledge of it, and the meaning we can ascribe to it. This view of epistemology believes we create knowledge that dictates what kind of knowledge that is. KO theory is then considered in the nomothetic vs idiographic debate, but neither side is given preference and given a simple “committed or uncommitted” naming (Tennis 2008).

But the positivist view of epistemology fades and is given a different tone. It is admitted that the variegations of interpretations make the defining and using of epistemology a difficult problem. And researchers require a mixture of epistemic stances in many cases, because method or the acceptable results of research may be in conflict with sources of evidence or what knowledge of reality means, the thrust of the work is in designing methods where one can look for the single source of valid data for organizing knowledge. (Tennis 2008)

Switching to communication theory, a nomothetic agenda is pushed by using an axiology philosophical assumption the idea that “explanation, prediction, and control remain the essential goals of science as such, but science should be used (without compromising its methodological and ethical principles) to advance toward moral and political objectives” (Craig, 1993. p. 31). I am not writing this to debate the merits of using social sciences to improve society, but I do not think it should be the sole purpose. My issue is the readings are pushing hard label on what theory or communication theory should be, when I think of typing communication theory as what it could be.

**What Communication Can be**

If communication and theory were easily definable, they would have been already. It is like trying to catch fog with a net. Communication is formless and formable. We lack even a coherent vocabulary to discuss the large amounts of ideas, theories and aspects in communication (Craig, 1993). It is as if communication changes from person to person, culture to culture or even concept to concept. Even as technology changes, researchers are still looking at how our communication changes with it. Just how the newer theory of Interactive Media Effects (TIME) uses determinism to analyze how communications technology user interfaces influence users by giving them the sense of being in control (Sundar et al., 2015).

The bias and uncertainty of communication is why it is so important to study it. Biases and all. Dialogue in the discipline will advanced as we reflect on the various modes of theory and their characteristic biases and limitations (Craig 1993). If we want to strive to create universal definitions that will help us advance society and move away from softer discourse-focused social sciences - that is great too. So, Why are there so many communication theories? Let us talk about that and create some theories.
