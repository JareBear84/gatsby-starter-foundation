I love classic rock music. Well, I should specify that I love the rock music of the 1970s and even most of the glam rock that continued into the 1980s. A lot of young adults today consider *classic rock* to be bands like Nirvana or Red Hot Chili Peppers, and my middle-aged heart really can not take that kind of truth.

Because of my love for classic rock, I instantly had the hit song *Black Betty* by the band Ram Jam stuck in my head as I read the Goldman & Waymer (2014) study involving the television series *Ugly Betty*. I desperately wanted to include the song in the reading response as some sort of clever joke that will explain and illustrate the key points of the assigned literature. I began with some research into Ram Jam and their hit song to see what I could use in the response. To my horror, I discovered that Black Betty originated as an African American slave work song, and the actual *Black Betty* is possibly the name of a slave driver’s whip (Cornelius & Cornelius, 2004). 

What do I do now? Is that really what Ram Jam had known when they played their hit? Could they mean a number of other references Black Betty was used for in US history? Is is culturally appropriate for me to use the song as a joke? How offended would readers be? If only there was some qualitative method that would help me ask questions to experts and other participants in a scene to get an idea of the social pulse on this subject... like interviews and focus groups!

The purpose of an interview would not necessarily be to prove anything right or wrong for qualitative purposes. It is a way to better understand the interviewee. Communication is not only about transmitting something, but making sure it is received. That meaning must be mutual. Interviews create meaning between participants and their material surroundings rather than the interviewer’s perspective (Tracy, 2019). I would not want to just know if Black Betty is fine for me to use for levity in an academic assignment, but I would want to know how the song is perceived. 

How do people in the US feel about this song? Does it change across age, race or gender demographics? Should I apply media framing theory to see how media has framed our view of popularizing songs potentially associated with slavery? I will have to understand the song in the nonreactivity context and understand that this audio document’s meanings will vary across different times, places and readers (Lindlof & Taylor, 2017).

Before I begin, I will have to ensure that any recording devices are set up and working. I should also decide what questions I should ask and what kinds of questions they should be (Lindlof & Taylor, 2017). When developing interview of focus group questions, it is important to remember not to lose sight on the project’s guiding research questions and purposes, affiliated literature, and any other empirical materials (Tracy, 2019). There is a large variety of question types to ask, and choosing the right ones will come down to experience and familiarity with the subjects or the scene. 

Researchers have the option of using interview schedules or guides. Schedules are more rigid and formal while guides are more flexible and open (Lindlof & Taylor, 2017). While there should be some room for adjustment, improvisation and refinement during the interview. It is not recommended to change much on-the-fly during an interview as it could lose focus (Lindlof & Taylor, 2017). It’s almost as if our previous readings regarding the four seasons of ethnography was correct in suggesting interviews being conducted in the fall season as to give the researcher time to adjust and understand the subjects and scenes (Gonzalez, 2000).

Maybe the best option for my Black Betty study would be a focus group. Just like Goldman & Waymer (2014) study, I want to understand the impact something may have on our ideas of what our culture and society deem as beauty, or in my case appropriate and not appropriate. It could be a good idea to engage in complementary interactions to get an agreed consensus on what people think is inappropriate or passable in today’s social consciousness. 

However, it could try to lean another way in argumentative interaction to generate conflict among my focus group to better understand the logic behind subjects’ conclusions (Lindlof & Taylor, 2017). I hope they allow me to record the session instead of taking notes the whole time. I would like to engage in active listening to so I can retain the small nuances and details to remain engaged in the group discussion (Tracy, 2019)

My hypothetical focus group is over, and I will need 15 minutes to just take it all in (Tracy, 2019). Was my tone correct? Were my questions free from jargon? Will I have enough time to transcribe my recordings or should I let a program do it automatically? I hope I made the right decision on focus group instead of just probing cultural researchers or conducting content analysis. Either way, this damn thing gone wild.
