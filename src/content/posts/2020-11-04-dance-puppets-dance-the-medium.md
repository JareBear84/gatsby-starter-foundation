Allow me, if I may, to momentarily cast aside the negative mask I used as a metaphor for my contrarian personality under the guise of politeness theory (Littlejohn et. Al,. 2017). The readings this week helped me realize that there were words and active studies about aspects of my behavior and thinking that for most of my life, I assumed, were just quirks or flaws of a sheltered, isolated child who was ruled under the strict thumb of authoritative, zealous parents. As it turns out, little Jared could have been a cultivation theory researcher’s dream come true since all I knew about the outside world was through the lens of the television camera eye (Littlejohn et. Al,. 2017).

Jokes aside, it was great to see that the experience of being swept away from reality into the world of the media being consumed was given a name - transportation theory (Littlejohn et. Al,. 2017). I would constantly experience it as a child, but not so much in my adult years. I am assuming because ontological knowledge gained from experiences while aging, which also allots for mounds of cynicism. I would push to expand transportation theory beyond the audience consuming the media, to those building the content. 

As an improviser and performer before coming to Vriginia Tech, the best types of performances, both from the audience and from the performers, were during scenes when the players were in such sync that they forget they are on a small stage and are actively feeling, thinking and investing in the scene. We honestly forget what those scenes are about after we finish because we are what we call *outside of our heads*. I would also even expand it to artistic expression in general without need for plot or characters. I have often gotten lost in the landscapes I create when I paint. Maybe that is a concepts to consider for further research for my classes, no?

It was also nice to know that spiral of science theory is defined for people like me with unpopular *hot takes* know they will not be taken seriously, so they stay quiet (Littlejohn et. Al,. 2017). That is why I enjoy writing these reading responses, because they encourage taking risks as long as they are thoughtful, productive and cited (for the most part). It is refreshing to know that any independent ideas expressed will be at least entertained without the fear of it affecting a grade or eligibility of an assignment. I can express myself and the unique individual I am, at least the unique individual I thought I was until we read more about what the media has done to me.

**Marionette of the Media**

For every theory I learned that helped me identify my personality, I found more theories that made me feel like a Frankenstein’s Monster amalgamation of influence, molding and manipulation by the media and those who utilize the media. I put the negative face back on as we are told, ”...the media no longer are in the background, merely reporting on, explaining, or critiquing other pillars of society: the media themselves comprise their own pillar while at the same time serving as a central structural component of each other pillar.” (Littlejohn et. Al,. 2017, p. 152) Thanks, mediatization!

There is nowhere to hide from this influence. It is not just a Unites States problem, as indicated by the dominance of the media micro frames metacommunication and speculation in media from Romania during the kidnapping of Romanian journalists in Baghdad in 2005 (Constantinescu & Tedesco, 2007). Whether it is a hypodermic-needle of influence into my metaphorical jugular or just a small tray of finger food sized selective exposure, I am being influenced, because data does not show that the audience influences media (Littlejohn et. Al,. 2017)

There seemed to be some hope (see what I did there? Hope, Obama? I am clever.) in the study about the Obama campaign and grassroots efforts that promoted trust, openness, involvement, commitment, and investment in the relationship, which sounds great, but first and foremost, why anyone would think it is a good idea to make a website that sounds like “My B-O” is beyond me (Levenshus, 2010). 

However, the principles that the online campaign promoted seemed surface-level. They did not silence if there was dissection among ideals within the campaign, but the managers interviewed for the study used language like “reinforce the perception of being part of the staff community” (Levenshus, 2010, p. 329) when it comes to getting volunteers involved in their campaign, which means they were still following the influence of the Obama train.

Is there hope with new media theory? Will we be able to create a democratizing, user generated media that follows the social integration approach to create a new community? (Littlejohn et. Al,. 2017) I hope so. Maybe I can be the one who leads it. I have experience in marketing and communication. I know how to build an online following. As a Millennial, I am sure I can create an online community of the future. To prepare my candidacy, let me update my LinkedIn that I only know how to use half of. (Watkins & Smith, 2020).
