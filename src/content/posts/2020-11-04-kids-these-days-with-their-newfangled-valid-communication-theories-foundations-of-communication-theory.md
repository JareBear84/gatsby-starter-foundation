description: We are all different, and the formation of an academic study of
  communication outside of journalism and mass communications was a hard battle.
  But the new theories and methods of communication research do not invalidate
  its importance.

Just because something is different does not necessarily make it less legitimate. This is an issue that humanity has always struggled with, including Europeans classifying the indigenous people of the Americas as “primitive” or “others” to more modern theories of race and economic inequalities as a byproduct of a normal society (Vidich, 1994). The same could be said for a more recent area of study and theory that doesn’t quite fit the traditional mold of science - communication theory.

The practice of the academic study of communication is a fairly recent endeavor as it started after World War II when Wilbur Schramm helped establish the first academic program in communication study in 1947 (Rogers, 1994). While more than 70 years of academic study may seem like a long time to establish documented and agreed upon meanings, definitions and tested reviews of communication theory, communication studies is still a newer subject compared to the other sciences, even in the social sciences area. Communication itself is also far from a concrete concept. 

The introduction of communications studies out of the gate went swinging as most universities didn't create new schools or departments, but Fit into already existing departments of speech and journalism. This led to conflicts like the the green-eyeshades and chi-squares groups that debated the absolutist unquestioning practice of journalism against the more qualitative research-focus of communication (Rogers, 1994). This conflict was very relatable since I have a degree in journalism and was trained in Associated Press style, media law, with a dash of Public Relations theory. After graduating, my journalism and broadcasting school changed its name to communication and new media and the concept of communication research is shell-shocking and making this response difficult to write.

In our readings, it has been established that the definition of communication is difficult to define and will be debated into the future. Instead, the sum collective of multiple ideas and theories will define the right kind of communication for the right perspective (Littlejohn et al., 2016). This kind of concept clashes with the stark view of scientific study by Paul Davidson Reynolds (2007) that argues that without a shared agreement on meaning, scientific knowledge could not be transmitted from one generation of scientist to the next. The abstract and multifaceted community of terms and ideas that make up communication are dismissed as legitimate science. It’s asked “For if there is no agreement about the meaning of a concept of statement, how can there be agreement about its usefulness in organizing, explaining, predicting or providing a sense of understanding?” (Reynolds, 2007 p. 12)

Reynolds’ words are a dangerous all-in poker hand of absolutist philosophy dismissing philosophic concepts until he can prove them with numbers or some sort of quantitative data. The types of questions communicator researchers ask go beyond the capacity of science and is “more of a religious or philosophical nature and cannot be resolved with an empirically based science.” (Reynolds, 2007 p. 2). I think that is the beauty of communication. Communication is inherently contextual. Just because communication theories and philosophies can’t be unilaterally defined and proven as consistently as principles that can be duplicated and retested in a controlled environment commonly used in physical or biological sciences doesn’t mean it isn’t any less scientific.

A part of science is understanding. Researchers strive to better understand ourselves, each other and the reality around us, which are constantly changing, fallible and complex. That is the human experience. Communication theory is seen as any organized set of concepts, explanations, and principles that depicts some aspect of human experience (Littlejohn et al., 2016). Each human experience is unique, borrowing from epistemology, and that unique experience obtains knowledge about what constitutes existence, and about what is valuable. According to the readings, the theories developed from studying communication should be seen as a statement or argument in favor of a particular approach or particular way of seeing the world. (Littlejohn et al., 2016). Understanding the different views helps us understand those views, which can make all definitions of communication correct.
