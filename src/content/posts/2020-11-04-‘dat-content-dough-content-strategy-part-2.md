  fit whatever your platform needs.

The chapters in this week’s readings covered different dimensions of the same general concepts that the previous 14 chapters and previous readings throughout this course expressed - creating content that can be applied that can be utilized and recycled autonomously throughout multiple platforms, departments, and consumers. The chapters this week focused on the content strategy including power publishing, content context, user-centric modular building blocks, and more. All of the chapters in this book could be summarized as comparing your content strategy to everyone’s favorite modeling compound - Play-Doh.

It may be easier to focus on creating Silly Putty since it can copy newspaper texts, or Gak because of the sticky factor, but none of these formats are capable of going through the heart-shaped cookie-cutter press or push it through the trough to make spaghetti string. The different compound materials may be good for their specific format silo (Bailie & Urbina, 2013), however, they can’t adapt and mold to the different needs children need to play.

Play-Doh is adaptive, manipulatable and ready to squeeze and fit itself into whatever shape, style or context it is needed. Just like the way we create a content strategy, our copy, or message, needs to be ready for a variety of methods, platforms and consumer types across all aspects of the organization. Us as content creators need to be aware that what we create will be used in marketing efforts as well as customer support efforts and beyond. Our consumers use different devices to access our content, and we have to be ready to deliver the same quality of content to each device. Content better be adaptive if i want to read my lawnmower manual from my fitbit Charge, by golly it better do it.

How do we use our systems and programs to fit all of the intricacies of content management to fit the variety of customers with different attitudes, experience, and expectations? Getting the customer the right content is all about semantics, baby (Bailie & Urbina, 2013)! One of the most popular was to get that metadata going with XML, which is a markup language like HTML but can vary on industry or organization using different schema. How can content be reusable and formable and be used by multiple platforms if the metadata being used is industry specific?

I had a small issue with the focus of this book in general - the concept of content strategy for business. The book focuses on business, particularly large businesses. For example, the book covers in-depth the process of the customer life cycle, which isn’t as applicable to smaller organizations, startups, nonprofits and public entities. While there is some life cycle to customers in the sense of donors for charities, students turned alumni, etc. However, they should be treated differently, but I feel the book leaves that aspect cold. Developing these kinds of content strategies are useful for large companies, but for small businesses, startups, nonprofits and public entities with poor funding, it is near impossible. 

I worked in communications for a University in Oklahoma, and while the book discuses ”your customers don’t care about your org chart” (Bailie & Urbina, 2013, p. 147), I do know the students do not care about it, but the entities with grant money that keep the lights on want to know exactly where the org chart is and sometimes they demand key documents be no more *than three clicks from the main page* or else funding gets pulled. It’s the same with figure 23.2 (p. 231). We as content creators at a university know what students and parents are looking for, but universities have many demands beyond customer foot traffic. We need to have certain content in certain places in order to maintain accreditation. It does not matter how well we can accommodate a potential or current students when we can not keep the doors open because we lost our authority to provide education. We would love to fix this, but as the book mentions, there is an elephant in the room called budget (p. 247).

I agree with many of the points provided in the book. I would support the idea of not having to waste time copying and pasting content from the desktop site to the mobile site, however, I think more needs to be said for those who are being left in the dust of progress. Maybe this way of change is creating a gap in those who can afford to change and those who can not.
