I wish I had read *Web Content Management: Systems, Features, and Best Practices* (2016) five years ago. As a new content creator in the late 2000s, I didn’t really have to worry about the major workings of content management systems (CMS). I could just type my blog, newsletter or other marketing material into Wordpress, add a plug-in here and there, then watch my view count and comments grow as I coordinated social media and email marketing efforts. My words were building an audience, and I knew enough HTML to change some design aspects of my content in a pinch. There was no need to questions what and how my content was being managed. 

Fast forward to 2016 and I was promoted to a position with a different employer who handed me an outdated Drupal website that had been glued together with copy and pasted content with patchwork HTML used in the content userface to keep the rain form leaking through the roof because updating the CMS could disable functions of site’s shaky foundation.

I had to learn everything the assigned reading covered through a trial by fire as the “digital marketing guy” by my employer. I completely agree with Cathy McKnight that CMS acquirement, implementation and development should not be made by just one department, but from representatives from all aspects of an organization (Baker, 2016). Choosing a CMS is not like picking a ripe apple, the softest recliner or any other product. It is more like building the best LEGO, or studded interlocking plastic building block, sculpture that meets an organization’s needs.

Choosing a CMS would be like choosing what brand studded interlocking plastic building block to use. LEGO is a popular choice, but they are expensive as they often use the proprietary avenue of CMS where they have kits that do specific things well. You can get the Millennium Falcon to take you to space, or a pirate ship kit to go on water, or the Batmobile that will take you to the streets. They’re difficult to make them fit any other build, but a creative LEGO master could make it work. Just like “A stellar implementation can make a mediocre CMS work for a particular project”(Baker, 2016, p. 42).

The out-of-the-box CMSs are like buying a pre-built PC or a Apple computer. IT serves a small, precise function for a particular use. They use proprietary parts, making upgrading ram, graphics cards, or other hardware nearly impossible unless though the manufacturer. Any customization is costly and generally lacks the quality of other hardware. Builders will also have to be conscious of their block brand as the stacks might not match with the IT department. You can’t stack LEGO on top of MEGA BLOCKS (See what I did there?).

You could make your own blocks out of wood, which would be fine at first, but would make it difficult when expanding to hundreds or thousands of whittled interlocking blocks. There would be many unknown unknowns that have already been figured out by LEGO. The trend is also to have user generated content. How would that integrate into a K’Nex, CaDa Bricks, or homemade wood blocks? Maybe we could be lazy and just install Livefyre. Is Livefyre still around? Kind of. It was purchased by Adobe in 2016 and is now a part of Artificial Intelligence-powered content management software (Business Wire, 2016). Wow, that looks like something I will have to look into for future projects in this course.

What is best for the individual is not always what is what the studded interlocking plastic building block makes want. Their advertising and sales tactics drive a wedge between content and design. Decoupling has its place, but it is bad for CMS software companies to pitch features instead of how they can help teams communicate and function across a single site. It may be best for an entry-level employee to not worry about any aspect of design, but many like me were dropped into both areas without any training. Content developers should be aware and somewhat experienced in some design so that I could have seen it like a LEGO piece instead of wasting unnecessary hours using content to cover up holes in a website using basic code.
