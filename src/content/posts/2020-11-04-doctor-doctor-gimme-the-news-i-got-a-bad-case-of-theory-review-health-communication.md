description: I like making jokes, but when reviewing common health communication
  theories, I learned that humor was a big factor in not just how to manipulate
  and influence others, but cover and cushion the harsh realities of disease and
  sickness.

I have never considered the health and medical field to be a laughing matter. Blame the current US health care system, blame the toxic masculinity standards I am expected to hold, but I do not like hospitals, doctors, pharmacies or any of the lot. My wife jokes that I could come home with a missing arm and say, “I’ll give it another week to decide if I need to see a doctor.” I hate dealing with it, and I am dreading each passing year knowing that my body is quickly breaking down, and I will have to rely more on health experts no matter how well I eat and how much I exercise. 

What shocked me the most about the readings this week was how much humor was threaded throughout the theories and articles. Granted, I have used humor in my reading responses as a way of either working my brain around the complexities of describing hard-to-define theories or methods, or to make light of some issues I may have with the subject matter being written about, but humor in health communication seems to be much more... manipulative, or deceptive. It underlines the horrors and sadness that can come with communicating life or death.

Smith & Brunner (2016) analyzed a case study of a blog by scholar Bud Goodall by applying communication privacy management through his journey of cancer diagnosis. It never occurred to me that someone’s blog could be a valid artifact of serious study. But then again, why not? As the findings of the case study dictates, humor was was arguably one of the clearest themes throughout the blog. Goodall’s humor was used as a privacy management strategy to reveal his true thoughts and feelings (Smith & Brunner, 2016). Humor was not used to necessarily bring joy or to lift spirits, but to soften the foreboding realities and struggles of living with cancer. Goodall claims humor is the only response that offers hope (Smith & Brunner, 2016), but I am not so sure I buy it. It is like when some people who laugh at horror movies as a defense mechanism when scared or terrified (Carroll, 1999). 

I do not claim to have known Goodall and my assumptions could be incorrect, however, the samples read in the Smith & Brunner (2016) study reminds me of of a deeply layered and complex form of fear control where he was not denying or ignoring threats (Littlejohn et al., 2017), but using humor to mask things. I also wonder if Goodall could possibly fit into anxious group of risk perception. He was already diagnosed, but the humor does come across to me as deflective and I questions whether is helps in addressing the threat. Then again, we are narrative creatures, so maybe I’m building on narrative theory and painting my own pictures of what it means to be ill the consequences of dealing with it (Littlejohn et al., 2017).

Humor also played a part in health messaging and behavior change. Just as Goodall’s real-time narrative of living with cancer (Smith & Brunner, 2016), we can use humor to create a narrative that enacts change or fights resistance. Humor is a big part of entertainment, and we can use that humor to help message be nonthreatening, which will aid in overcoming any psychological reactance (Littlejohn et al., 2017). Humor in narrative also helps establish a stronger connection with the audience to the characters. The Marvel superhero movies seem to be so incredibly popular because of the witty quips the heroes make us cheer for them, which is an example of parasocial interaction (Littlejohn et al., 2017). It feels manipulative, but I understand the necessity when it comes to the life-or-death situations that the medical and health care industry deals with on a daily basis. As mentioned earlier, some people like me assess and avoid the perceived risk through fear control or avoidance (Littlejohn et al., 2017). Health practitioner need to do what they can to communicate these issues as effectively as possible.

The other way this information is communicated with through responsive group of risk perception (Littlejohn et al., 2017). Just like how respondents who used the Web to search for cancer information were better able than were respondents who did not seek information to achieve a level of uncertainty commensurate with the level of uncertainty they desired (Raines, 2014). If we can provide humorous but light hearted information that is easy to access, we can help feed uncertainty management theory and be a valuable resource to those looking for information before consulting with people or professionals directly. I might be more inclined to visit and interact with a doctor if I have reliable information about an affliction that is not WebMD. Now if you will excuse me, I have to find a new doctor in Virginia to refill the blood pressure medicine that I am on thanks to graduate school. And that is no joke.
