description: Dr. Stubing, is your PI for this voyage. Grab your partners,
  friends, co-workers and acquaintances, because you will find out why you
  bother putting up with any of them in the first place. Are you a gossiper? Do
  you have mommy issues? Want to take down the power indifference from an
  oppressive patriarchy or challenge heteronormativity? Ladies, gentlemen, and
  beyond, welcome aboard the RelationShip.

Have you heard of the *Love Boat*? Well, forget that unrealistic, fantasy world. This fantasy world is based on something more realistic, definite, yet refutable and still debated today - theory. My name is Dr. Stubing, and I will be your PI for this voyage. Grab your partners, friends, co-workers and acquaintances, because you will find out why you bother putting up with any of them in the first place. Are you a gossiper? Do you have mommy issues? Want to take down the power indifference from an oppressive patriarchy or challenge heteronormativity? Ladies, gentlemen, and beyond, welcome aboard the RelationShip.

“Well, I do not see an engine. How are you powering this thing?” You may ask. Well, all RelationShips are driven by the biological instinct and desire to survive, validate, and mate thanks to affection exchange theory. There is a dedicated engineering crew to help maintain a healthy RelationShip by using positivity, openness, assurances, sharing tasks, and social network. (Littlejohn et al., 2017)

Are you with your family? Not to worry! Our director of family engagement, Lt. Schema, will provide a quality orientation that combines levels of conformity and conversation to place you in one of four (or even a combination of) camps - consensual, pluralistic, protective, laissez -faire (Littlejohn et al., 2017). No, we are not going to fix any of your family issues. We on the RelationShip are just going to let you grow up into an entitled young adult (Sergin et al., 2012)!

But watch out! The rocking of the RelationShip is not due to high tides, unpredictable weather, or the fury of the sea. That disorientation you are feeling on the boat is just a little privacy turbulence. A well built RelationShip has a sturdy, well-defined boundaries thanks to engineer communication privacy management theory, but sometimes those boundaries get broken for one reason or another. The crew and guests are a passionate bunch. However, because of that passion, if the RelationShip encounters privacy turbulence, most of our guests would use passive responses as a form of retaliation (Smith & Brunner, 2017). As with privacy turbulence, you may notice a little leakage. The RelationShip, given engineer communication privacy management theory is supposed to give you a reason to trust and never doubt out crew. However, pirates with dubious intentions can infiltrate your RelationShip and lead you astray with ulterior motives. Our leakage is a sign that “Deception apprehension and suspicion can appear in nonstrategic behaviors, or behaviors that are not being manipulated” (Littlejohn et al., 2017, p. 255)

We thank you for choosing RelationShip. Come again to experience the pain, agony and annoyance that is being a human and interacting with other human beings!
