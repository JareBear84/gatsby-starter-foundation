The required reading for week 4 broke down the already broken down 13 subfields of qualitative communication research, three theoretical and five, I am assuming, regular traditions of qualitative communication, then ended with the considerations when planning and building a research study. The very beginning of chapter two stood out as very apt when comparing communication as a beast and organizing it into prime cuts like cattle (Lindlof & Taylor, 2017).

This allegory stuck throughout the chapters. What kind of beast was not only communication, but also what kind of beast was qualitative communication research? I thought i had an idea from the previous chapter in that it was a way of understanding a culture, questions, and the like through the lens of the research, which relished in that objectivity. However, as the proceeding chapters broke down and categorized the different aspects of research, qualitative methods, and communication, I began to lose the thread that connected everything into a bigger picture - the beast as it were.

**13 Subfields of Qualitative Communication Research**

The listing of the more popular subfields of qualitative communication research, from applied communication to rhetoric, was intended to help readers, who are more than likely new to the field of communication research, to showcase the areas that could align with their interests. It can help be a starting point for beginners to find a place to begin asking question and start researching. Many of the subfields, some including applied, activism, health, political, etc., pushed the axiological philosophical assumption of scholarship designed to achieve change or develop theories with values (Littlejohn et al., 2016). 

I feel like this could hinder some discourse and growth of the fields when the tool/researcher shares the same values as the subject and the research. It blurs the etic and emic part of field research and could exclude alternative viewpoints. I want progress for LGBT+, but there is a difference between being studied by someone on “the inside” compared to someone with an outsider’s perspective. It is like the difference between a Christian scholar and a scholar studying Christianity.

**Theoretical Traditions and Qualitative Communication Research**

An issue I had with the chapter was the lack of clear definitions for the traditions. The idea behind the chapter was to help visualize qualitative research as a whole by comparing it to a sandwich with the top and bottom buns being paradigms and qualitative methods with theory being the filling (Littlejohn et al., 2016). Theory and the definitions for theories are debated today, however the chapter presents these traditions mostly by explaining their origins and how they have changed from the positivist to the postpositivist paradigm while many have changed again in the critical paradigm. It is useful information, however very difficult to understand when as a beginning research student does not know what the tradition or theory actually *is* or *means*. 

The reading felt like I should have already known what the tradition was. I had to use a Google search to learn a basic definition of a theory, then reread the section again to make sense out of it. While not the same as a theory, it would be like a cook book trying to explain how to make a peanut butter sandwich, and the section about peanut butter covers its Canadian origins and how Jif is the brand favored by choosy moms, but does not explain to the reader what peanut butter is. Unlike butchering a bull to see the choice cuts of meat, cutting peanut butter just leave a soggy mess.

**Planning Research Projects**

The final two chapters presented a true introduction into the beginnings of qualitative research by where and how to formulate research ideas, look for locations to study at fields, sites and scenes, and how to gain access to those sites through gatekeepers or sponsors. The chapters covered also covered different tools and methods, other than the researcher, to utilize like surveys, still video and photography, interviews and more. On top of discussing sampling size, the readings ended with an overview of the ethical use of using humans as a part of your research and how the Institutional Research Board (IRB) should be involved and the basics of how to structure a research proposal.

For the most part, the information was valuable and helped me better understand the IRB training I received last week. Even with the review of the project proposal providing some clarity as to how the elements of what I have been learning since starting graduate studies (the title is supposed to use amusing wordplay while the subtitle is serious (Littlejohn et al., 2016)? Oops!) I still can not help feeling a little lost at how these puzzle pieces that have shape but kind of do not somehow fit into a research project that I create using the best pieces for the job. It should feel like ingredients for a recipe, but somehow these loosely defined puzzle pieces must be exact or else it would not be good research. I am just trying not to have a cow.
