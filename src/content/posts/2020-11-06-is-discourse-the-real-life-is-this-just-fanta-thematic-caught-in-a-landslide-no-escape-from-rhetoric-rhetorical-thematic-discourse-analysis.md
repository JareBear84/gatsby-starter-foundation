It could be argued that we do not really see objects, but merely see their reflected light from a source like the sun or a light bulb (Baluch & Gonzales, 2015). Much like the example of cup not really being a cup, but a symbol created by us to identify what a cup is (Foss, 2009), our communication - language, nonverbal, etc. are just symbols representing and shaping reality. *Rhetorical, thematic and discourse analyses* take an ontological approach of how the knowledge we create through symbol, themes and debate, and the meanings behind them, shape our views of reality. Even if epistemology is mentioned frequently with the methods that go behind the different analyses, these studies are still used to report and understand the reality of the studied participants (Braun & Clark, 2006).

When looking at rhetorical analysis, it is narrowing down an aspect of how we communicate to see how it affects our reality into an artifact. Comparing the analysis of an artifact to how a critic reviews a movie or restaurant opened my eyes to the concept of making statements about messages rather than statements about feelings (Foss, 2009). Despite considering myself a better-than-the-average-bear writer, there are many times I can not explain my reaction to something because I am focused on my emotion instead of the message. I hope to utilize this concept to make my critiques more eloquent, nuanced and substantial since I will learn to refocus my thinking. Another aspect of rhetorical theory is that the description of an artifact is in some way an interpretation, which allows researchers to share a unique perspective or different understanding of an artifact (Foss, 2009), however, this could open up to criticisms that have been warned of the misuse of relativism or flaw in epistemology that leads to bias or taken-for-granted assumptions, which could harm validity (Gonzalez, 2000). What also intrigued me was when Foss (2009) guided the plan of conducting a rhetorical analysis was to narrow down an artifact, but do not be specific when crafting a scientific question, however Brouwer & Hess (2007) started their thematic analysis with a very specific questions about the Wesboro Baptist Church. Granted, they are different analyses, but the contrast was interesting.

Expanding outward, critical discourse looks at the complex social phenomena using multiple methods and approaches (Wodak & Meyer, 2016). It sees written and spoken communication as social practice, or the body of knowledge as a whole from society, lifestyles, culture, etc., and focuses on how power is built and maintained through language and other forms of communication. I hope I did not generalize too much, because most of Wodak & Meyer’s (2016) explanations were about the history and other methods involved with discourse analysis without really explaining what it is.

Maybe the texts involving thematic analysis will be clearer and able to explain what it is. Let us see, “Thematic analysis is widely used, but there is no clear agreement about what thematic analysis is and how you go about doing it” (Braun & Clarke, 2006, p. 79). Great. Wonderful. Fantastic... However, Fay’s (2011) study of informal messaging in an office setting helped me better understand what thematic analysis actually is. The breaking down of messages into personal disclosure, sociality, support giving and getting, commiserating/complaining, and business updates and exchanges categories help me conclude that thematic analysis is a way of finding reoccurring or connected patterns or themes from a data set or analysis. At least, that is how I would explain it to a child or caveman. Although, I do feel like the study was a little vague on the explanation of constructivist methodology and a literature-based analysis. The same goes for articulation theory (Brouwer & Hess, 2007). At this point of reading and regurgitating theories and methods for more than half a semester has blurred and confused terminology a bit. I also questions some of the internal and external validity of the study because, while Fay (2011) admitted a difference, the same themes may not appear with workers who work face-to-face compared to the sample of workers who teleworked, and the workers where not very diverse and messages would change if it was a more culturally diverse group.

To break it down, rhetoric analysis looks at a cog in a watch and asks *What is this cog doing and how is it affecting the watch’s time telling*?, thematic analysis is asking *Why am I seeing more jewels when there is a more complex system or a greater amount of cogs in a watch?*, And discourse analysis looks at the whole watch asking *how are the mechanics of the watch and the cronometry to accurately grasp the measurement of the indefinite continued progress of existence know as time?* Maybe critical discourse would analyses how the watch’s strict measurement and confinement of an infinite existence can create a power imbalance, since power seems to be a central tenant of critical discourse studies (Wodak & Meyer, 2016), but I might be getting carried away.
