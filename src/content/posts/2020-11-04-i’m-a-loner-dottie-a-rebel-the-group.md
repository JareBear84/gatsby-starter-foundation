If I were to do my own fantasy-theme analysis using symbolic convergence theory about myself, I would be the lone wolf who is introduced in the shadows with my shoulder leaning against the tavern wall as I i stare into the distance. I am so cool! I do not need a group or party weighing me down or holding me back. I play by my own rules and I work better that way.

“But Jared the Barbarian. Don’t you know that two heads are better than one? Haven’t you read Aesop’s *A Bundle of Sticks*? You must realize that teamwork makes a dream work.” The Bard says to me. The funny thing is, because of the readings this week, I have come the the conclusion that people so crazy silly things when they start working together in a group.

I could try to take the humanity out of groups by using the Input-process-output model where i would see groups as cybernetic systems that take in data, processes it, and produces a consensus, however the model still wars about the humanity within as interpersonal obstacles because humans aren’t always clear on their intentions (Littlejohn et al., 2017). I may be considered too independent in the context of Effective Intercultural Workgroup Communication Theory, but I do not have a self, other, or mutual face (Littlejohn et al., 2017). A lone like me only has one face to worry about. You guessed it - my negative face.

But what about collaboration? If we are to believe bona fide perspective, groups are natural, and most theories in the readings provide how we approach groups and understand their structure and effectiveness, which are good things. I should accept the truth that groups are good. Except for the concept that participation in a group is unequal, and other in a group will take whatever time is not being used, therefore group participation is competitive (Bonito, 2001). You can collaborate all you want, but I won’t fight for a chance to help a group when I can help on my own. Binto’s (2001) findings didn’t even show much strong support for anyone with the right knowledge being more likely to participate or even if someone disinterested in me would stifle group conversation with the exception of people with more shared knowledge were more likely to communicate, which just sounds like virtue signaling to me.

The elephant in the reading response would be the obvious criticism of group communication - groupthink. Jaeger (2020) account of the groupthink experienced at the high school hit a little too close to home. I think public education, primary and secondary specifically, is one big exercise in groupthink. It produces good factory workers in a job market that should have moved on from factory jobs decades ago.

Jaeger’s story reminds me of a scene from *The Simpsons* episode *Lisa the Vegetarian* where character Lisa Simpson criticizes her schools lack of adherence to inclusive policies. Her teacher and cafeteria cook press an *independent thought alarm*, which causes the principal to conclude that the kids are being overstimulated and orders all colored chalk be removed from classrooms. I have even been a victim of groupthink in the corporate world. My first job after college saw many of our products change, very late into our production cycle, based on the whim of the CEO, and no one had the bravery to tell him if his changes were good or very detrimental or even costly. The *we have always done it this way* burned me to the point that now when I see a potential issue, i just figurative yell “The boat is sinking!” To any co-worker or adviser listening. It is very hard for me to be proactive and fix anything after that experience.

As a loner I fully support any means of going against the grain. It is almost like our world is putting the individual under it’s groupthink thumb. That is why I enjoyed the meme study of Obama’s war room as a reminder that the internet is using memes as a “symbolic reclamation of rhetorical powers by regular people who, through a shared cultural practice, supplement, undermine and even counter the dominant voices of institutions — the pop polyvocality of the digital age.” (Mielczarek, 2020). I do not think it is as severe as Mielczarek may suggest. There is no majority trying to belittle or negate the accomplishments of the Obama administration (However, I will admit that there are people online who would and do use them to make strong political statements and criticism). Juxtaposition is funny, and putting jokes into the serious and sometimes depressing realities of our lives is a coping mechanism.

I enjoy being a lone wolfpack. I do not need the baggage that comes with group work, as we can see with the readings. I feel it is more work to keep the machine oiled and running than doing it myself. I am proud to use an antisocial language like memes where only a group of people online share their ideas to make jokes and statements. A group... a group... Oh, God!
