description: Grounded theory is a theory-creating theory from data after
  observing a field. That infuriated me, so I talk to the Research Devil about
  my frustrations with grounded theory and beginning in academia.

I felt a little lost. I thought I had a fairly strong grasp on what qualitative research was. But as I read this week’s articles, the apparently subtle differences between methods were starting to blur together. It was expected of me to internalize and figure out what, how and why I want to analyze for research (Baxter & Jack, 2008). I closed my laptop for a moment, removed my glasses and rubbed my eyes.

“Knowing the details among case studies, regular qualitative research and grounded theo ry is of the devil...” I said out loud. Suddenly, the ground in my living room burst open with a fume of college debt and grant applications as a tall, fiery figure emerged from the ground. His skin was red with long horns forming from his long black hair. He wore thick glasses and a turtleneck shirt underneath a tan tweed blazer with elbow patches and brown slacks.

“Grounded Theory!” The unearthly figure proclaimed. There was a short pause as if it was waiting for a reply. “Get it?” The creature said, walking towards me. I gave no audible sound but expressed an indignant frown as I gestured to the hole in my floor. “Ah, you will get it later. Anyway, behold! I am the Research Devil, and I am here to make your academic experience the worst it can be. I see you were looking at some case study research?”

“Yeah.” I said, ”I think I might try it for...”

“Oh! Is it too complex for normal qualitative research, so you’re going explanatory? (Baxter & Jack, 2008) Descriptive? Intrinsic?” The Research Devil said with glee. “Oh! Will it be single or multiple case?”

“I do not know!” I proclaimed.

“Oh, just exploratory. That is cool, I guess.” The Research Devil said.

“No. I just do not know what it all really means. The differentiations among the different types of case studies are so close together with no real clear differentiation that they seem more like a matter of semantics instead of classification. Even with the women over 30 getting surgery example (Baxter & Jack, 2008).” The Research Devil began to wipe a tear from his eye.

“Spoken like a true researcher.” He said, “You are the tool after all, and if you don’t feel lost, scared, or unsure about you are doing and think you’re over your head, then you aren’t using the right method (Lindlof & Taylor, 2017)! Just make sure if you do use any grounded theory, you do one of the good grounded theories that is founded in good research (Goulding, 2017) if you want to get published. After all, grounded theory is a specific tool that is also generalized and widely used with many different schools of thought and meaning. You have to get rid of your preconceived bias if you want to use ground theory (Charmaz, 2011).

“That is my point!” I exclaimed, “This is the four season of ethnography all over again! The articles argue about using quality research and using good code and data in the research without telling the reader what good code or data is except for using gerunds, which is good and bad at the same time (Charmaz, 2011).”

“Oh, nice callback to last week’s readings. Professor will love that. And welcome to interpretivism!” The Research Devil opened his arms in a Vaudevillian style. “You will learn, soon enough.”

“I do not want to just learn. I want to understand.” I said “Right now, this is like a bunch of doctors telling me arbitrarily what is what. It is like legislators trying to regulate what the definition of milk is (News 9, 2020). I want clarity. I want peace of mind. But most importantly, I want to get rid of you!”

“I am hurt.” The Research Devil Cried as he sunk into the couch across the room. “If you took the time to ask about me, you would understand. You are focusing on the wrong details. Kahn (2019) tells you that these are about theory building. I’m here to help you learn that to get rid of me, you should probably finish your essay response.”

“Wait,” I exclaimed. “The primary focus of these reading along with case studies and grounded theories is theory building? (Kahn, 2019) Why was the Kahn (2019) reading the last study on the list? This would have made so much more sense if I had read that one first.”

“Research is not a straight line. Get used to it.” The Research Devil said with a facetious grin. I couldn’t believe that the entire point of the Research Devil being here was to teach me about theory building. This torture was only for me to develop an idea to get rid of him. With my mouth agape, I stared at him while shaking my head. “If you came in with an already established theory, you never would have written the response essay that summoned me and you would received no points! Or better yet, your theory would be inaccurate, and you would have never gotten rid of me. You are welcome!” The Research Devil said. I sighed a defeated but relieved breath of air and waved the Research Devil goodbye. As the ground opened up, vats of coffee seeped from the ground and a whirlwind of paper, pencils, highlighters and danced violently around him. The Research Devil gave me a thumbs up while saying, “See you when you start your thesis!” And jumped into the hole as it sealed like nothing had happened. I may not fully understand or appreciate the concepts addressed in the readings, but academia is about the pursuit of knowledge, and I will never stop trying to learn. The more I experience, the better I will understand.

I pause and look at the ground where the former hole was as a shock of realization hit me. “Oh, *grounded* theory! I get the joke now!”
