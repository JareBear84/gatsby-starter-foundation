What is an organization, really? Let us dive deeply into a pool of ontological philosophy. Beyond symbolically achieved cooperation (Littlejohn et al., 2017), what is it? Just like time does an organization have a beginning or end? As a collection of individuals working together to achieve a goal, an organization is like a crowded baseball stadium where everybody participates in doing *the wave*. For a brief moment, the wave is there. Fans are creating something real by working together, but is that wave real? When the fans stop doing the wave, where does the wave go? Did it even exist at all? Is an organization real? What is it, a person? Some argue that they are, at the very least, a metaphysical person with some constitutional rights (Manning, 1984). This entity made up of people has its own desires, fears and even culture. Even as I joked about being a one-man wolfpack last week, I have to admit that no matter what we may think what an organization is, we are living in an organization world.

We naturally give birth to these organizations merely by communication with each other thanks to Structuration theory where our communication creates patterns of rules and norms (Littlejohn et al., 2017). The very act of being human is what some theorize as the birth of organizations. And this structure creation ends up becoming a soulless loop because “structures provide individuals with rules that guide their actions, but their actions in turn create new rules and reproduce old ones.” (Littlejohn et al., 2017 p. 307). I, for one, welcome our organizational overlords. Even though I should not welcome them, because they are focused on one thing - themselves. Organization does not care about me, however it is obsessively concerned with its public image. So much so that organizations are willing to make a substantial response to an alarmed public due to an unsubstantiated claim (Viel et al., 2012). Organizations are more worried about their public image than anything else that it is suggested tat organizations work to own an overall persona called organizational legitimacy (Viel et al., 2012).

I find it interesting that organizations are not concerned about me. I am but one cog in a machine, or more appropriately one link in a network theory of multidimensional multiplexes (Littlejohn et al., 2017). I am disposable, and organizations expect to get rid of me as turnover is a natural part of certain organizations (Sheridan, 1992). A powerful enough organization can become a lifeblood for me to maintain shelter, food, and other necessities, but pass me by like the world’s smallest kidney stone for any reason, however organizations want to cry fowl about pizza hoaxes costing fan loyalty not being fair (Viel et al., 2012). A little selfish, aren’t we, organizations?

My loner ways have excluded me from organizational opportunities because I do not fit within their culture. Yes, these constructs use their worker bees as stories, rituals, symbols, and other types of activity to produce and reproduce a set of understandings (Littlejohn et al., 2017) AKA spin their own story! I always assumed that employees looking for a workplace culture fit was a Millennial aspect. I never thought workplace culture was being measured in the early 1990s as well. Although I do feel that the Sheridan (1992) study was a little too general and vague to capture an accurate depiction of workplace culture when considering the complexities and subtleties that go into culture being reduced to either interpersonal relationship or detail and stability values (Sheridan, 1992).

But maybe the concept interpersonal relationships in theory can help me focus my critical philosophy hat into a cone. I do not have to be a victim of this oppressive network or rules and structures. Feminist scholars agree with me that organizations are not neutral constructions (Littlejohn et al., 2017). We will no longer be the Cinderella to the organizations’ Prince Charming. The glass slipper he holds will not benefit the few who can fit into its mold while others must suffer the disadvantages (Littlejohn et al., 2017).

We may have brought these organizations into existence with our communication, but if we created them, we can change, mold and destroy them. If they go away, have they truly ever existed at all? Maybe we will never know, and maybe we will never get rid of them. But for now maybe we can all work together to achieve a little corporate social responsibility communication model.
