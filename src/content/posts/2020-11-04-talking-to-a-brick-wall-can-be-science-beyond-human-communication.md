This week’s reading was of particular interest since I have been researching actor-network theory (ANT) as it relates to machine agency for my quantitative research methods class in hopes of combining it with my studies of artificial intelligence into a melting pot for the hopes of making a thesis stew. To prepare for a good read, I took a warm shower with my empty shampoo bottles that I have yet to throw away, partially out of laziness/wetness and partially out of the bond I’ve shared with them. There’s *Head and Shoulders*, *HS* for short, who is an old bottle with a little bent spine syndrome because I squeezed him from the middle. There’s *Axe*, the cool guy in all black. And there’s *Ol’ Spicey*, who is like that crazy uncle where you do not like his scent, but you keep him around because he was all the family you had at the time. After cleaning, I prepared a cold beverage and loaded up the textbook on Lappy III (The third descendant of laptops I have owned since 2009 or so. Lappy III also proves that I am not as creative as I think I am.). Ready to embrace the philosophical theories and debates of the validity of human-and-object interaction as it relates to ANT, I was instead greeted with... objectùm sexuality? People who are in love and intimate with objects (Littlejohn et al., 2017)? All right. Okay, where is my negative face? I am about to get rude.

Jokes aside, I was disappointed in some of the concepts in the Littlejohn et al. (2017) chapter. Not because they failed to meet any standard that deemed it worthy of study, but because I felt the book was insufficient in explaining their relevance. As a person who grew up in a strict Christian home, I was told the non-believers at the universities study our faith differently and without the perspective of those who practice the faith. It was nice to learn that researchers do acknowledge the differences between prayer as persuasive and prayer as a tool to grow a divine relationship. But these concepts are nice for someone who had faith as a part of their life, but there was no explanation as to why or how this could be applied to other aspects of communication.

The revenge of the crystal theory, at first, sounds like a crazy hippie theory, but started to make a little sense. The concepts of objects losing value because they are readily available, and the value is just in the possession, could be a good theory used to study the rampant materialism of our corporate/capitalistic society. However, it looses traction when comparing aspects of the theory to the *Pirates of the Caribbean* movies. Yes, they are based on the ride, but in turn, they are something *new*. They bring new ideas and concepts with inspiration from the ride. It would be like saying Ancient Rome doomed us all because it based many of its culture on aspects of Greece’s culture.

We study language, nonverbal and spoken, and we know that it changes and molds as time changes. To claim we are separated from the world and we will reach hypertelia because our concepts of objects change over time feels shortsighted. Despite the creepily accurate description of communication from the future, Carey (1980) provided a concept of future communication as separated, not revolutionized. Even his description of early radio becoming a cultural soup playing the same news, talk, guests and music along with ownership of television being monopolized Carey is very reminiscent of new media today as PR, marketing and other communicators are required to produce content that can be recycled through the different channels and functions their organization uses and easily used by other programs and aggregators (McGrane, 2012).

What was not short sighted was the concept of media dependency theory. I’ve wondered how the news media and our political divide has gotten so crazy. I always suspected that September 11 and the 24 hour news cycle was a factor, but the study by Lowery (2004) highlighted some of my suspicions. I assumed the fear of 9/11 caused normally rational older generations to react in an extreme manner and gravitated toward a more conservative view. One of the supported scientific questions in the study was “The greater the dependency on media during times of social crisis, the more likely behavior/attitudes will reflect the dominant portrayal of the crisis (Lowery, 2004 ,p. 346). At first I was thrown off because the study suggested younger generations were more dependent on traditional media than older. However, I have to remember that 9/11 was nearly 20 years ago, and those in this study who were considered younger are in their 40s-60s now - that prime demographic the 24-hour cable news networks are targeting.

They study also concluded that “Individuals depended on TV and newspapers more than they relied on interpersonal communication. Individuals who used radio, print media and web during normal times relied on TV to a grater degree in the months following the crisis, and the leading force behind this change was perception of threat” (Lowery, 2004, pp. 353-354). So, people turned to the media more than each other and greatly influenced behavior after 9/11. And as many of us know, the 24 hour news channels are often not considered news. Certain media networks do not call some of their own content as news (Folkenflik, 2020). This emotional push of hyperbolic entertainment has pushed emotions and loyalties on both sides of the political spectrum for nearly 20 years. It is cultivation theory all over again.

Granted, I used personification of my household items as a silly way to show that the examples in the book weren’t as silly as I made them out to be. I have a strong connection to ANT, and I found it difficult to let go of my bias as it related to artificial intelligence. However, I was fascinated by media dependency theory and the study relating to the theory to 9/11. I would like to see a follow-up longitudinal study to see how media dependency has influenced these generations as they became the older generations of today in the wake of the current political climate.
