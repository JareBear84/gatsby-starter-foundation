I have come to the realization that I am old. It did not happen when I was honestly excited to receive socks as a Christmas gift. Nor did it happen when my wife made fun of me for complaining about musicians like Billie Eilish and Drake, not because of the quality of composition or the content of their lyrics, but because they are rich and famous for breathy mumbling instead of just singing like a singer should. No, I felt old after reading the required passages, because I realized the new, revolutionary tactics and best practices in marketing and communication I learned a decade ago are now becoming outdated and extinct.

Digital content must believe in global warming, because it utilizing recycling content and automating its distribution. I was surprised to see that even something as bland, straightforward and uniform as technical writing was utilizing content management to standardize its content by reusing and redistributing content for a more efficient workflow (River, 2020).

As the readings continued, I felt a sadness combined with defensiveness. It was not me who was losing touch with modern audience trends. It was the new CMSs that are taking away to human touch to content, separating them into chunks so they can be plugged and played to a variety of platforms and services to be consumed. Content creators today don’t have to be creative, they just shove bulleted lists and snippets onto a conveyor belt like the 1930s song Powerhouse plays like a Looney Tunes episode as it gets recycled for different venue for people to consume and pass on like a kidney stone.

However, is the writer or content creator still king? Even when it comes to creating a flexible and slightly automated system for sharing content, content is still needed. Even when it comes to writing for mobile, “There is no ‘how to write for mobile.’ There’s only good writing. Period.”(McGrane, 2012 p. 95) There will still be a need for writing. There may be a need for increased content creation to produce multiple headlines or summaries for the different needs of the systems that will pick up and distribute content. But, is that really writing? Making it short, sweet and adaptable for multiple devices and platforms is a good skill, but does it get to the heart of the content? Where’s the voice? Where is the personality? Does it matter since kids these days have no patience and want instant content now? Ironically, we reuse content for people to consume and throw away for the next content in their feed.

I guess that is the next phase of content marketing. It is no longer a watercooler. 10 years ago, content creators could use blogs to create remarkable content that would build SEO and the audience would come. In another example of irony, we have reverted back to strategically shotgunning our content back to our market, but this time our content shifts to meet their needs and schedule. So, in a way, it is slightly less intrusive. It is a efficient way of delivering ones content. The beauty of efficiency is that we’ll never see a dynamic market change like COVID-19 that could disrupt the packaging supply chain and cause shortages of necessities... Oh (Slate, 2020)

Either way, this new factory of content seems more complex and intricate. It could be more efficient, but this kind of symmetry, programming, design and teamwork does not seem cheap. Is this new way of managing and distributing content expand the gap between the large organizations and the smaller organizations that can’t afford these systems, which means they will never pierce through the noise? I seriously wondered that, but I also think this question has been asked with every emerging trend and technological advance. I mean, who could afford a whole social media team 10 years ago?

Sunset is still an hour away, which means this old communicator needs to get to bed. I have to get up early to complain about kids today and their recyclable content. Back in my day, all I needed was a podcast and some adwords to grow my business! They don’t know how good they have it.
