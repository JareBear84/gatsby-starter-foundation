After a few weeks of taking this seminar and combing through the weekly readings, I think I have either come to the conclusion or maybe even confirmed my suspicion that I got into marketing and communication for the wrong reasons. I do not want to really admit it, however, the whole reason for attending graduate school is to change careers and end the unsatisfying trajectory it was headed. Looking back, maybe the choice to study public relations was desperation. 

When 19-year-old Jared was facing graduation from community college, he had a choice to make - take his acting, performing, stage play and film writing college credits along with his stage, film and other artistic experiences he build in a small town in Oklahoma and move to one of the coastal cities to try for a career in entertainment while working at coffee shops living in poverty in the hopes that he could be that 2 percent who find success? Or chose to study PR to establish a career that still allowed him some creativity with much less competition or more respect among peers? Obviously, little Jared took the safe path.

All of this needlessly long introduction is to express that with the growth and evolution of content and how it is managed, I feel like the other kind of creativity is best utilized for success. The introduction to DITA showed that to me. What does *other creativity* mean? I often associate creativity with freedom and expression in what id being created. It is the author who pours life into something, fitting each piece into it like a puzzle to make a moving yet effective piece. 

Granted, marketing and communications is not high art, nor should it. However, we are still storytellers, and still must put the humanity behind even the most boring of press releases or flyer. With DITA, content management systems, and the continuing separation of content and design, I feel like the kind of creativity that is needed to succeed in content creation and communication is the kind of problem-solving creativity to maximize its usefulness in the system instead of it’s ability to capture the audience.

Again, marketing content is different than the wide variety of content like technical writing, and every technical detail that goes into the organizing, distribution and reusing of content all goes back to support the content strategy (Rockley et al., 2009). But I feel like I will have to sacrifice creativity for strategy. 

I am old, I guess, and I want to customize my content for may audience. In my experience, social media users will sniff out companies and individuals who use programs like Tweetdeck to post the same message across all platforms. However, the book argues against this concept by saying “In our experience, following guidelines for clear, effective writing makes content usable, regardless of the medium or format in which it appears” (Rockley et al., 2009, p. 6). But, who am I to push my measly decade of experience against Rockley’s 30 years of experience?

My only other pause with this book is the odd choice of writing. While the book does give a good basic outline of why DITA and XML are necessary and how they work together, I feel like the book lacks any form of actual implementation. As someone who has a little HTML experience, I think I know what DITA is after reading this book, but I am not fully certain. I can not imagine anyone with no development exposure. 

Also, the book sometime is oddly written or unnecessarily written. Take for example the phrase, “Content which is unique is just that, unique.” (Rockley et al., 2009, p. 52). Ignoring the improper use of *which* in a defining clause, what good do phrases like these have in this book for authors and managers who probably have a better grasp than me on grammar? I feel like this cut the professionalism of the book a bit.

I may be overreacting to the idea of how content works with DITA and the future of content management. If I want to teach comm students what to expect in the professional realms of the future, I need to be aware of those skills and practices of content management.
