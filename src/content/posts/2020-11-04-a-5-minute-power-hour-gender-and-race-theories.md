description: I explore the idea that racism, discrimination and other forms of
  prejudice do not usually come from hate, although it can and does sometimes,
  but it comes from oppression and maintaining power. I explore gender and race
  theories to show how power plays into their core functions.

Power. It is not just the amount of energy used to operate things like electronics, mechanisms, or even biological functions, but it is also the control or authority over something. Power is a concept I have never really given much thought since it is something I have never been drawn to. It always seems like a double-edged sword with a plethora of benefits on the surface, but the responsibility keeps a target on your back. Any problems are instantly your fault no matter if you had anything to do with it. The target also means that others vying for that power, waiting for those at the top to fall. We play our own *Game of Thrones* but with fewer beheadings and dragons.

However, people play that game with ferocity. Our myths, media and cultural narratives seem to revolve around the conflict of good and evil over the pursuit of power. From the 13 colonies fighting to break free from the oppressive power of King George III to the average blockbuster movie with the brave hero stopping the mustache-twirling villain from world domination. The fight for power is a common narrative, and we are oddly drawn to it as a culture. Just look at who is the elected president of the US. We glorify those with significant power and encourage their cold, calculating and inhuman sense of business.

Power is the driving force behind critical race theory (CRT) and feminist theory. I always associated prejudices like racism, sexism, and homophobia as a byproduct of hate. While, some of it does come from and is fueled by hated, a key passage in the reading in the passage noted that racism is not stemmed from hate, but oppression (Han & Price, 2015). Separating oppression from hate is a new concept I never considered before. Individuals with love in their hearts can still enact prejudice because it is about keeping the power. They have an arguably misguided view on how things should be to maintain their privilege, not necessarily because they believe in the superiority of their race, gender or other identifier. An example would be the group interests argument that claims white prejudice is to maintain white privilege (Brown, 2014).

This is where CRT comes into play. It is meant to challenge the dominant ideology by understanding how white supremacy developed and still lives in the US and how it oppresses people of color (DeCuir-Gunby et al., 2019). CRT originally started as an analysis of how law is used to oppress minority races, but has grown beyond to look across different aspects of social and cultural norms. CRT research has focused primarily on qualitative research methods with many researchers arguing that CRT is fundamentally inconsistent with the notion that numbers are neutral and objective, however, CRT research has included quantitative and mixed methods in attempts to help white researchers and critics understand the oppression (DeCuir-Gunby et al., 2019).

CRT also analyses and criticizes the attempts the dominant ideology uses to hide its repressiveness. One common issue brought up is colorblindness. In an effort to dismiss racism, many people will claim not to see color and treat everyone equally. Some argue that this viewed and compared to the dominant oppressive way of life, meaning everyone is expected to act white. Distinguishing color in law vindicates the oppression of minorities by past legal classification (Gee, 1999).

Another method used to reverse the perception of oppression but ended up being oppressed is the model minority myth (Gee, 1999). The concept of the model minority was something I was aware of and personally fascinated with when I learned about it on a random episode of Adam Ruins Everything a few years ago. Upon further reading I learned that it originated from Chinese immigrants, which Americans ended up calling the yellow peril. After World War II, communism gained popularity and criticized the US use of racism. To counteract this, the US created the model minority propaganda of smart and successful Asian Americans, and even sent an all-Chinese immigrant basketball team to tour overseas (Wu, 2015). It is argued that the model minority stereotype is used to keep other minorities oppressed with the idea that compared to successful Asian Americans, other minorities had no one else to blame for their struggles but themselves (Wu, 2015).

Other than law or money, another tool used to oppress minorities is language. Just as Han and Price (2015) observed, interviewed, and conducted causal conversation with multicultural families in Korea, particularly the immigrant wives of those families. The results suggested that languages like Chinese and Indonesian were not considered economically strong, so the immigrant wives needed to suppress their culture by teaching their children a more economically desirable language. Plus, the article suggested a patriarchal ideology since the Korean husbands did not learn their immigrant wives’ languages.

Speaking of the patriarchy, we also have feminist theory, which also takes the critical philosophy of research to question and study dominant ideologies. Particularly, we studies a qualitative approach through an ethnographic study through active participation and interviews in a feminist organization called SAFE (Ashcraft, 2000). The study saw how a proclaimed feminist organization that provides aid to abuse victims handles itself compared to typical bureaucracy. Feminist critique links bureaucracy as a benefit to men, which creates gender inequality. It suggests that there is a strong connection linking the boss-subordinate hierarchy as masculinity’s power over others (Ashcraft, 2000).

The author notes that the policy created through a seemingly feminist process ended up much like the bureaucratic policy that feminist theory critiques. I think the irony wasn’t lost on me nor the author that an organization with the purpose of aiding and supporting individuals of abuse from relationships eventually established a “strict” relationship policy. Maybe SAFE was still being influenced by the lingering dominate bias of the traditional bureaucracy, or maybe because working with abuse victims influenced the discussion towards separating relationships (Ashcraft, 2000).

Then again, outside of organizational communications, feminist theory embraces agency as contradiction (Littlejon et al., 2017). So maybe the contradiction is what makes the company real and legitimate? Either way, I can identify with these critical theories. Even as a straight white male, which is the epitome of oppression right now, I still do not fit into the model role that I am supposed to play. I have seen the wheel of opportunity roll right past me because I would not play nice. As the wheel passes, it is no super villain, but someone in power telling me, “It’s nothing personal. It’s just business.”
