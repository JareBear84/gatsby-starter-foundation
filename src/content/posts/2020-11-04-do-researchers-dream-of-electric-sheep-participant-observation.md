For more than a decade, since I was an undergrad, I joked about being able to get away with doing anything if I did it wearing a white laboratory coat. If I was found possessing a large quantity of illegal drugs, I would say, “It’s for research.” If I had stolen a car, I would say, “I only did it for research.” If I was caught in a room full of prostitutes performing various immoral and possibly illegal actions, I would say, “Its’ research. Someone has to!”

But in reality, and especially after this weeks readings, conducting research isn’t that simple. Not only does the approach and planning of conducting field research depend on who a researcher is and how one will practice their study, but also researchers need to be emotionally aware about themselves and their objects, but at the same time have the ability to turn off and on their emotional empathy in a way that does not affect their research, like some sort of robot.

When observing the participants in the field, we do so to get a rich and vivid account of communication that interpret its contextual significance for its performers, or what I will forever call behind closed doors - *a piece of ‘dat thick description* (Lindlof & Taylor, 2017). To crate the best observance we can, researchers have to avoid or at least reduce marginalization. Just like being an older female would help gain more detailed and genuine accounts from workers in a brothel compared to a male researcher who might have better access to brothel customers since they tend to be male (Meneses-Falcón, 2019).

The story Pearson told debunked my lab coat joke as qualitative researchers need to be aware of themselves and what kind of master role they can be - complete participants, participant-as-observer, observer-as-participant, or complete observer (Lindlof & Taylor, 2017). Once a researcher decides on the best role for their observation, the readings continued to discuss the ethical challenges that they will face. Not just the ethical seek first, and do no harm mantra, but how far an ethnographer will willing to go to to maintain their master role.

This idea was explored in the reading about the researcher who had to perform criminal activities, which were really mostly misdemeanors, for the sake of keeping his complete participant master role as a fellow football hooligan (Pearson, 2009). The ethical questions are a case-by-case basis and should always be considered as the situations evolve. Lindlof & Taylor (2017) mention spontaneous decision making is a skill necessary for success.

But an ethical question came to me as I was reading that stuck with me the entire time. It points back to this emotional on and off switch like a robot mentioned in the introduction of this response. Observers are supposed to build trust and relationships to get accurate accounts for research. They are also supposed to remain emotionally objective, as long as it doesn’t interfere with the natural actions of the participants or site. Is it really ethical to build trust with participants, even if they know the observer is there for research? How ethical is that?

Observers develop strategies of showing sympathy to overcome the distance that existed between the researchers and those seeking help by asking questions like *How are you today? Is everything okay with you?, etc. (*Augusto & Hilário, 2019). Do observers really care or do they want to know as it may be pertinent information for their research if a participant is having a bad day. In some cases, they aren’t participants yet, they are trying to build a rapport to they can agree to participation. Our readings even mentioned risked losing analytic detachment and *going native* without some distance through consistently writing field notes (Tracy, 2000).

Tracy (2000) even quoted an earlier edition of our textbook (Lindlof & Taylor, 2017) to knowing the feelings, predicaments and contradictions of the ‘other’ than to be with the other in an authentic relationship. But how authentic can authentic be when the motivations behind the relationship is for the benefit of the research instead of something more mutually beneficial? Granted, it could benefit subjects in the long term as the study may help to progress a social or cultural issue, but this illusive *progress*, I feel, betrays the deep inner trust that is risked when we build relationships with others.

This is idea is reflected in the Tracy study as it also reflects the same ideas and themes ethnographers will experience as they conduct their studies. Just like cruise line officers will have to be emotionally *on* continuously for months without a day off, so are qualitative researchers channeling their emotions and building these Frankenstein’s monster forms of relationships for days on end. Qualitative research *is* emotional labor.

Are we human-less robots observing others under the guise of humanity only to put our humanity into the analyzing of the data when finished with the field? Even if we self identify, how genuine or deceiving are the relationships we build with the participants? Either way, I’m going to grab my white lab coat and board a Norwegian Cruise Line ship. There would be a lot of research I could do that would get me out of serious international trouble.
