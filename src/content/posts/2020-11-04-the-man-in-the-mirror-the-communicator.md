The readings for this week diverted from the usual theme from previous weeks of looking at communication from a generalized perspective where we learned about the philosophies, contexts, levels, and more to help us contextualize and understand where communication comes from and how its theories will apply broadly. The “camera” was turned around and focused on the individual. Not just from a professional communicator, but how communication theories can apply to individuals who socially engage in sports (Watkins & Smith, 2020), date online (Gibbs et al., 2011), or donate to disaster relief (Waters, 2008).

I felt a little “attacked” as it is used casually on the internet when the first factor model of trait theory lists Neuroticism, or the tendency to feel vulnerable, anxious, and unstable emotionally (Littlejohn et al., 2017). After being diagnosed with severe anxiety in 2016, it’s never fun to see my problems categorized like data instead of an ailment, which ironically is what this book is doing by categorizing to better understand us. It is not lost on me. As this self-reflection stayed in the back of my mind, I dug deeper into my insecurities when thinking about the theories of identity. Am I defined by my anxiety? Is my anxiety a social object that I’ve based a plan of action on because of how my culture and society has influenced through symbolic interactionism (Littlejohn et. Al,. 2017)?

Or is Shakespeare correct when he said, “The world is a stage?” Am I, a 30-year-old with anxiety who quit his job and moved his family half way across the country, just pretending to be a researcher? Am I just performing? Is this opportunity at Virginia Tech what I really wanted? There has to be some theory to describe the regret I am feeling for doing something good about my life. Oh, yes, it’s cognitive dissonance. But maybe someone would feel cognitive dissonance by looking at this wreck of a graduate student and be more likely to donate to help make themselves feel better (Waters, 2008).

But This reading response is not going to be a sad review of the documents. Social object are mine, and I can treat them how I want to. I can the same outlook on life as sports fan despite expectancy violations theory (EVT) and be just as socially engaged if my team (or life) is losing more than I expected (Watkins & Smith, 2020). Maybe i just do not know myself well enough. I am living in a constant state of uncertainty reduction theory and performing reduction strategies like I am trying to go on a Tinder date (Gibbs et al., 2011) with myself.

The readings do end on a high note as it covers queer theory as it almost came out of Standpoint theory in that it needs to push against the standpoints of dominant groups, and queer theory “seeks to ‘trouble’ the categories of sexuality and identity by showing them to be social constructions created in discourse rather than essential, biological categories.” (Littlejohn et al., 2017 p. 83) There are even theories of agency, which is about my capacity to make a difference. While some theories see agency as some fluid, influenced, changing sphere of a form, Other theories are more supportive. And no matter how confused I get, there will always be the acceptance that yes, I am full of contradictions, but that is what shapes me and makes me human like a good contradiction theorist. (Littlejohn et al., 2017)

If my social object is just a reflection of society, culture and my experiences, I can still push against the grain. There is no harm in some pragmatism. My social object may be influenced by my experiences, my culture and surroundings, it is still my social object. Something this personal is not perfectly applicable to every theory mentioned in the readings. But I like to use myself in a humorous manner to better understand these theories. Now, if you will excuse me, I have a Tinder date with myself.
